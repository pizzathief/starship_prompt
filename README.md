# starship_prompt
just my current starship prompt settings, in case anyone is interested.

Not sure if a licence is applicable, but just selected gpl anyway.

Intention was to have an extra line above the prompt with info I was interested in, 
and keep the prompt line itself as close to bash default as possible.
